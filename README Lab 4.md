## ⚙️ Tasks Performed

### **Task 1 – Verify VM Resources in VMware**
- Checked and confirmed allocated resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space for the virtual machine.

### **Task 2 – Start VM and Log In**
- Booted the virtual machine using the preferred host terminal method.
- Verified successful login to the Linux environment.

### **Task 3 – Filesystem Exploration (Root Tree & Dotfiles)**
- Explored Linux filesystem hierarchy (`/`, `/home`, `/etc`, etc.).
- Viewed hidden files and directories using CLI commands.

### **Task 4 – Essential CLI Tasks (Navigation & File Operations)**
- Practiced directory navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`).
- Performed file operations like creating, moving, copying, renaming, and deleting files using commands such as `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`.

### **Task 5 – System Info, Resources & Processes**
- Retrieved system information using commands like `uname`, `top`, `htop`, and `df -h`.
- Monitored system processes and performance metrics.

### **Task 6 – Users and Account Verification**
- Viewed and verified existing user accounts.
- Used commands like `whoami`, `id`, and `cat /etc/passwd` for user management insights.
- No sudo group modifications were made as per lab instructions.

### **Bonus Task 7 – Create a Demo Script**
- Wrote and executed a simple Bash script demonstrating automation and scripting basics.
