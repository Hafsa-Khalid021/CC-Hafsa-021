## 🧩 Tasks Included

### **Task 1 – Handling Local and Remote Commit Conflicts**
- Understanding `git pull` vs `git pull --rebase`
- Resolving synchronization issues between local and remote repositories.

### **Task 2 – Creating and Resolving Merge Conflicts Manually**
- Simulating merge conflicts by modifying the same file in two branches.
- Resolving conflicts manually to preserve both changes.

### **Task 3 – Managing Ignored Files with `.gitignore` and Removing Tracked Files**
- Creating and testing a `.gitignore` file.
- Untracking previously tracked files using `git rm --cached`.

### **Task 4 – Temporary Changes Using `git stash`**
- Saving uncommitted changes temporarily.
- Restoring them later using `git stash apply` or `git stash pop`.

### **Task 5 – Checking Out a Specific Commit**
- Using `git log` to identify commits.
- Checking out older versions using `git checkout <commit-id>`.

### **Task 6 – Resetting Commits (Soft vs Hard Reset)**
